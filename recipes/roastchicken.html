            Sprinkle some salt onto the chicken and sprinkle over the surface of the chicken some olive oil and herbs.
            Then place the chicken into the oven at 180 degrees celsius and leave it there for 40 minutes, after 40 minutes pull it out
            and with a spoon take the oil at the bottom of the platter and pour it over the chicken. Place the chicken back into the oven. Repeat this 
            process two more times and your roast chicken will be ready.
